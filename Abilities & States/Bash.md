# _Bash_

Type: [[Abilities and States]]

[[Player]] stops time and redirects [[Categories/Enemies]] and [[projectiles]]

Shout out to the devs of Ori and the Blind Forest for realizing the Bash Ability.
It took months to arrive at something as intuitive and practical as in Ori. When starting, I didn't even know Ori moves with the projectile to an "ideal" position when bashing to avoid clipping into the environment. Also, there is a "bash buffer" when you press Bash in Ori, and nothing is close by; Ori will continue to try to bash in the subsequent frames.
