# _Randomizer_

Type: [[Game Modes]]

----

Various aspects of the game are randomized. Logic is used to make sure the game is beatable
Look at ori randomizer dat to see how they do pickup assignment 
During randomizer show generic pickup icon on map, until seen. Look how dread randomizer does it 
Rando logic with and without having to use teleport 
Dk vs ori Rando, random starting abilities vs spawn based

Need to decide between:
	[[Metroid Dread]] makes you have to save to keep items
	[[Ori and the Blind Forest]] lets you warp from any where and keep items

### Options
* pick starting abilities
* random spawn
* [[Plando]] - lets you the items

### Usability features
* button to show last 5 Pickups
* tracker to show what has been picked up

## Likes from other games
