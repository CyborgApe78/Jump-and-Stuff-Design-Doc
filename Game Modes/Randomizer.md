# _Randomizer_

Type: [[Game Modes]]

----

Various aspects of the game are randomized. Logic is used to make sure the game is beatable

Need to decide between:
	[[Metroid Dread]] makes you have to save to keep items
	[[Ori and the Blind Forest]] lets you warp from any where and keep items

### Options
* pick starting abilities
* random spawn

### Usability features
* button to show last 5 Pickups
* tracker to show what has been picked up

## Likes from other games

* [[Hollow Knight]]
	* adds a split of direction for abilities
* [[Metroid Dread]]
	* Which [[ability]] is used to open a [[Doors|door]]
	* [[Pickups]] show what they actually are on map
* [[Ori and the Blind Forest]]
	* In logic shown on map
