## Dislikes
* [[Combat]] was fun, but would have preferred the focus on [[platforming]]
* Freezing game for item pop up
* Magnet shouldn't take a trinket slot  
* having to abilities swap for for world interactions, like flap, wall destruction
* Sometimes would use the wrong ability since dash/burrow and bash/grapple on the same button
