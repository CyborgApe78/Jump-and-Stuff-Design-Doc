# _How to make a platformer feel good_

Type: [[Articles]]

----

Basic feel goods to add
	Sticky feet on land
		Will need accel and decel first
		Quick stop when landing if input is opposite of move direction
	Push up through a semisolid 
		Make a collision box that detects it is in a semisolid (and still holding jump) and put player on top of platform
		Could use for multiple abilities like dash
	If the joystick is slightly pushed, donâ€™t go over edges
	Add platform momentum to character (looks like godot 4 does that)
	Extend wall detection when trying to use abilities
		You can actually wall jump 2 pixels from a wall. (That sounds tiny but this is a 320x180-resolution game :P)
		If you're doing a "super wall jump" (ie: a wall jump while dashing upward), this is a more precise and demanding maneuver so we let you do it from even further away (I think it's 5 pixels, which is more than half a tile!)
	Wall ability control
		different jump if holding up
		jump/dash way from wall
