Interested in adding something like this


### Notes from other people

Walking speed
Running speed
P-Speed
Walking and running speed are pretty intuitive, but P-Speed is reached by filling up a meter by going Running Speed
(And as it doesn't get reset to 0 instantly you can drag out the filling of the P-Meter for some time)

There's also ways to go beyond the p-speed cap in smw, for example sliding.
However when you press the directional pad it resets that speed, so the way to keep it is by not pressing any directional keys and keeping yourself away from the ground.
