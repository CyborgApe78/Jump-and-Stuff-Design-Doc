# _Regrab_

Type: [[Mechanics]]

This doesn't work well with [[Double Jump]], need to decide which to keep


## Similar in other games

* [[Super Mario World]]
	If you press the jump button (regular or spin) and then immediately release it, you will jump to a low height and fall very quickly back to the ground. If you are moving horizontally, you will have a very short horizontal range.
	If you press the button and hold it, you will do a max height jump and fall slowly and floatily back to the ground. If you are moving horizontally, you will have a long horizontal range.
	But if you combine the two, you can get a short jump height and a long horizontal range. You tap the jump button, then immediately regrab it near the highest part of the jump. This way you can make it across wide gaps under low ceilings. (Typically, you will do this using a spin jump because the max height of a spin jump is lower.)
