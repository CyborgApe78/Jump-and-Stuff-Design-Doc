# Jump and Stuff
#### Design Doc & Wiki

https://github.com/CyborgApe78/Jump-and-Stuff

A game world similar to [[Ori and the Blind Forest]], with a focus on platforming and exploration, [[environmental hazards]], [[escape sequences ]]instead of boss fights, and dungeons.

Learn new [[abilities]] from [[transformations]] (or other environmental stuff WIP). Inspired by [[Sheepo]], [[Mario Series]] power ups and [[Banjo Series]] transformations. Abilities will have ways to chain together to keep momentum going. [[Ori Series]] Series, [[Metroid Dread]], [[Prince of Persia Lost Crown]] movement abilities with the [[Super Mario Odyssey]] and [[Celeste]] [[Ability Interactions]]. 

Access new [[locations]] with new [[abilities]] and [[Environmental Changes]]

Happy and colorful world. Still deciding between Vector or 3D art style

[[Collect-A-Thon]] aspects inspired by [[Banjo Series]], [[Mario Series]], [[Donkey Kong 64]], [[Disney Illusion Island]]

Repeated quests, like [[races]]/[[time trials]] and [[kart races]]

Built-in [[Randomizer]] to extend gameplay. 
 
A focus on playing well on the Steam Deck and taking advantage of control depth

[[Mechanics/Bonk|To Bonk or not to Bonk]]

Using [[Godot]] 4 game engine

Also includes my thoughts on games that have inspired me to work on my own game

Dream features:
* Variety on the [[Abilities]] and [[Ability Upgrades]] like in [[A Robot Named Fight]]
* Multiplayer, like [[Super Mario Odyssey]] and [[Hollow Knight]]
	* [[tag]], [[prop hunt]], [[co-op]]
* [Archipelago Integration](https://archipelago.gg/)
* [[Quick Save]] like system for practicing
* Dual screen (NDS) style touch screen on Steam Deck
* [[Tracker]] pop out window for item tracking during randomizer
* Add external music use like [[Donkey Kong 64]] music randomizer
