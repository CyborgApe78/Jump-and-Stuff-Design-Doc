[[Jumps]]

A game world similar to [[Ori and the Blind Forest]], with a focus on [[platforming]] and [[exploration]], [[environmental hazards]], [[escape sequences]] instead of boss fights, and dungeons. Abilities will have ways to chain together to keep momentum going. [[Ori]] Series, [[Metroid Dread]], [[Prince of Persia Lost Crown]] movement abilities with the [[Super Mario Odyssey]] and [[Celeste]] ability combos. Built-in [[randomizer]] to extend gameplay.

Happy and colorful world

A focus on playing well on the [[Steam Deck]]

Using [[Godot]] 4 game engine

Also includes my thoughts on games that have inspired me to work on my own game

Dream features:
* Variety on the [[abilities]] and [[upgrades]] like in [[A Robot Named Fight]]
* Multiplayer, like [[Super Mario Odyssey]] and [[Hollow Knight]]
	* [[tag]], [[prop hunt]], [[co-op]]
* [Archipelago Integration](https://archipelago.gg/)
* [[Quick save]] like system for practicing
